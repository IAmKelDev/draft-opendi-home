Examples of this pattern abound, from NTSC/PAL for televisions to DOCSIS in broadband networks, to standards that specify how a set-top-box talks to a television, to the TCP/IP and HTML standards that made the internet explode.</p> <p> Figure 1: Convergence/Divergence pattern of technology</p> <p>Importantly, these open interoperability standards specify how technology from different entities communicates with each other.  Importantly, this is different than open source standards, which unlike interface standards, actually make public the inside of the technology boxes. With open interopability standards, vendors can still create proprietary (secret) systems; it is only the way that they interoperate with other systems that is open.</p> <p>When good standards are built, technology markets explode: often creating huge benefits from the buyers of that technology.  A good example is the standards underlying the internet.  I (LP) used chat rooms, email, and connected computers starting in the 1970s before these standards existed, and it created massive friction compared to what we see today.  I remember when the internet standards became widespread in the 1980s/early 1990s and what a difference that made!
