# Contributing to OpenDI Standards

We're glad you want to help out!  
OpenDI is a community initiative, so these standards are open to feedback and contributions.  Contributions and feedback follow typical GitHub processes.

## Feedback

This project has two main channels for feedback submission:

- GitHub Issues
- OpenDI Discord Server

Feedback should follow GitHub best practices for [submitting issues](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github#opening-an-issue) and [for contributing via fork and pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) . The following sections provide additional detail for these processes.

### GitHub Issues
GitHub Issues are best for providing actionable feedback about individual projects, including:

- bug reports
- requests for new features or additions
- suggestions for alterations or specific constructive criticism
- etc

To submit an issue,

1. Navigate to the **Issues** page of the relevant repository (links below).
2. Use the **issue search feature** to see if your issue/report/suggestion already exists.  
    If so, feel free to add additional discussion in the comments section of the existing issue.

### Discord
The OpenDI Discord Server is best for providing general feedback about projects, or the OpenDI initiative as a whole. You can also join in ongoing conversations with experts across many Decision Intelligence fields!
